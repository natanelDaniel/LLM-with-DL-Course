Emotion Detection using GRU and PyTorchThis project implements an Emotion Detection system using a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network, trained on text data (Twitter responses). The system is designed to compare the performance of different word embedding strategies: Learned Embeddings, Pre-trained GloVe, and Self-trained Word2Vec.The core requirement is to build a robust system that can systematically compare models across various embedding and training hyperparameters (e.g., freezing the embedding layer).1. Project StructureFilePurposemain.pyMain execution script. Runs the comprehensive comparison loop for all embedding/freezing configurations, handles training, evaluation, and plotting.config.pyStores all global hyperparameters, file paths, and experiment settings (e.g., EMBEDDING_TYPE, GLOVE_PATH).model.pyDefines the GRUEmotionClassifier PyTorch model architecture.data_utils.pyHandles data loading, text preprocessing, vocabulary building, and loading of external GloVe/Word2Vec embedding files.train_word2vec.pyScript to train custom Word2Vec embeddings on the training dataset.fetch_glove.pyUtility script providing instructions for obtaining and configuring GloVe.requirements.txtLists all necessary Python dependencies.data/Directory containing train.csv, validation.csv, and test.csv.emeddings/Directory where GloVe and Word2Vec embedding files are expected to reside.experiment_results/Output directory where plots, confusion matrices, and comprehensive reports are saved after running main.py.2. Setup and Prerequisites2.1. EnvironmentThis project requires Python 3.8+ and the libraries listed in requirements.txt (which is currently open in your Canvas).Install dependencies using pip:pip install -r requirements.txt
2.2. Data and Embedding ConfigurationAll file paths are defined relative to the project root in config.py.Training Data: Ensure your train.csv, validation.csv, and test.csv files are located inside the ./data/ folder.GloVe Setup (If EMBEDDING_TYPE is 'glove'):GloVe is pre-trained. Run python fetch_glove.py for instructions on how to download the glove.6B.100d.txt file.Place the file inside the ./emeddings/ folder.Verify the path GLOVE_PATH = r"emeddings\glove.6B.100d.txt" in config.py.Word2Vec Setup (If EMBEDDING_TYPE is 'word2vec'):Run the training script: python train_word2vec.pyThis script will train Word2Vec embeddings on your train.csv data and save the vectors to ./emeddings/word2vec_vectors.txt.Verify the path WORD2VEC_PATH = r"emeddings\word2vec_vectors.txt" in config.py.3. Running ExperimentsThe main.py script automatically runs a comprehensive comparison loop across all embedding types and fine-tuning options.Run the main script:python main.py
